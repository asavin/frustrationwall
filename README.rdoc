==Frustration Wall

A small social web app made during 2 days long hacking weekend. Ruby on Rails is serving as a main framework, with jQuery, some CoffeeScript and CSS3 flavors. Twitter Bootstrap is again used as a base UI framework. UI layout is fully responsive and should adapt nicely to any width of the browser. 

The idea behind the service is that users can quickly share their frustrations with the world, give and receive love. After some point their enlightenment level increases so that the Big Red Button becomes available. By pressing that button any user can relieve everyone from their frustrations. The backend will also dispatch emails to the registered users saying that "all your frustrations are gone now".
